--------------- THE DEAD STAR --------------

In the hush of solitude, where shadows dwell,
Echoes of laughter and tales we used to tell.
Among memories vivid, where joy once shone bright,
Lies a void where your presence was once the light.

Once ablaze with warmth, your spirit soared high,
Filling days with meaning, painting life with sighs.
But time is unkind, stealing you away,
Leaving behind echoes of our yesterday.

Each moment now a memory, bittersweet and frail,
A testament to friendship, a bond that will prevail.
We cherish the moments, now frozen in time,
Your laughter, your kindness, your spirit sublime.

Oh, dear friend, a soul so true and rare,
Your absence leaves a void, too heavy to bear.
Though you have left us, your spirit still resides,
In the hearts of those who loved you, where love forever abides.

For even in your absence, you illuminate our lives,
Guiding our hearts through sorrow, where memories thrive.
In the tapestry of friendship, where stories intertwine,
You're our forever friend, in our hearts you'll shine.
